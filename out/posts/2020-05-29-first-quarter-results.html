We are fortunate to have the expertise to help with initiatives that can benefit the country and save lives and our team has done tremendous work. As with all other industries across Canada, the last few months have been challenging and our media business has had campaigns paused or reduced while clients adjust to the impact of the COVID-19. We have taken several measures to address these changes including a review of all unnecessary expenses, a concerted effort to ensure investments are focussed only in areas of growth, and the furloughing of certain employees. Although we are starting to see clients resume their previously paused campaigns, we continue to monitor closely to best protect our financial position and our investments.”</p>
