# Company Website

EQ Works company website.

## Framework

This website was built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

Next.js is built around the concept of pages. A page is a [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the pages directory.

## Content

There is a "blog" aspect to this website. This is where we post Press Releases, Case Studies, Insights, and more. To do that, we are using the Headless CMS platform [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). We create the content on Contentful, and then leverage Contentful's [Content Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/) to request and render that content.

Once we are ready for posting, we will provide helpful walkthroughs of that process right here. Stay tuned!

## Guidelines

In order to achieve a high level of quality and maintain consistency throughout, we adhere to the guidelines laid out in this section.

### Accessibility

We are committed to comply with [WCAG 2.1 level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). We will be using this [WCAG 2.1 quick reference guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&showtechniques=126%2C127%2C128%2C129%2C136%2C144%2C145%2C146%2C147%2C148%2C149%2C1410%2C1411%2C1412%2C1413%2C211%2C212%2C214%2C221%2C222%2C223%2C224%2C225%2C226%2C231%2C232%2C233%2C241%2C242%2C243%2C244%2C245%2C246%2C247%2C248%2C249%2C2410%2C251%2C252%2C253%2C254%2C255%2C256%2C311%2C312%2C313%2C314%2C315%2C316%2C321%2C322%2C323%2C324%2C325%2C331%2C332%2C333%2C334%2C335%2C411%2C412%2C413&levels=aaa#top) set to level AA compliancy as our auditing guide for design and development iterations.

### Code Formatting

All code must formatted to the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) configuration file.

- Check code format, run `npm run syntax-check`.
- Format code to Prettier configuration, run `npm run syntax-format`.

### Components

Order element attributes alphabetically. For example:

```jsx
<Smile aria-label='smiley face' role='img' />
```

### Styling

- Styling for this website is using [styled-component](https://styled-components.com/).
- Order selectors alphabetically. For example: `a {} h1 {} p {}`.
- Order declaration properties alphabetically, but ignore vendor prefixes (`-webkit`, `-moz`, `-o`, `-ms`). Meaning `-webkit-box-shadow` should be treated as starting with the letter `b`.
- Order action selectors alphabetically.
- Place `@media` declarations at the end of properties.
- For example:

```scss
.container {
  /* declaration-property: declaration-value */
  -webkit-box-shadow: none;
  display: inline-block;
  font-family: 'FontRobotoBold', sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
  p {
    color: $color-white;
    &:focus {
      background-color: #790100;
      color: $color-black;
    }
  }
  ${breakpoint.sm`
    font-size: 12px;
    padding: 14px 20px;
  `}
  .item {
    border: 1px solid $color-grey;
  }
}
```
