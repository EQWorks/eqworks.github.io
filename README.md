## Project setup

This website was built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:
- `dev` - Runs `next` which starts Next.js in development mode.
- `build` - Runs `next build` which builds the application for production usage.
- `start` - Runs `next start` which starts a Next.js production server.

Next.js is built around the concept of pages. A page is a [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the pages directory.

To start developing your application run `npm run dev`. This starts the development server on http://localhost:3000.

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.
