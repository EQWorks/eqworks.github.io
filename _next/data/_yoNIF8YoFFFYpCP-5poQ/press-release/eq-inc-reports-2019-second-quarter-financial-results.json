Gross margin of 49% is significantly stronger than last year, again resulting from the increased data revenue.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from operations before: (a) depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, (b) share-based payments, (c) finance income and costs, net, and (d) depreciation of right-of-use assets. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of the Company's operating performance because it provides information on the Company's ability to provide operating cash flows for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in its industry.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The non-IFRS financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in the Company’s  consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of IFRS financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-IFRS financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-IFRS financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-IFRS adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The table below reconciles net loss from operations and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"nph7if1oawhd"}},"id":"4qysVv29iS3mQy9Hjfzuzp","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-09-03T17:59:31.381Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-03T18:32:32.312Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Financials - 2019 Q2","description":"Financials - 2019 Q2","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/nph7if1oawhd/4qysVv29iS3mQy9Hjfzuzp/047ae9c64945fdc42285a01a06053c7f/eq19.jpg","details":{"size":42580,"image":{"width":648,"height":302}},"fileName":"eq19.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"About EQ Works","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"EQ Works (www.eqworks.com) provides a smarter way to target customers.
