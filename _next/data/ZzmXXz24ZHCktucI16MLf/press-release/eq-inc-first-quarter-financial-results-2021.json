Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of the Company's operating performance because it provides information on the Company's ability to provide operating cash flows for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions.

Because non-IFRS financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-IFRS financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-IFRS adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The table below reconciles net loss from operations and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"nph7if1oawhd"}},"id":"7eKy9rDj5HZh43SQ6hubY2","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-05-28T13:20:57.976Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-28T13:22:05.625Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"EBITDA 3 months","description":"EBITDA 3 months","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/nph7if1oawhd/7eKy9rDj5HZh43SQ6hubY2/288bee846a042f3348e03582f4eb7aae/Screen_Shot_2021-05-28_at_9.21.46_AM.png","details":{"size":133792,"image":{"width":1376,"height":816}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2021-05-28 at 9.21.46 AM.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Subsequent to quarter-end, The Company granted 282,500 stock options to directors and employees of the Company.
