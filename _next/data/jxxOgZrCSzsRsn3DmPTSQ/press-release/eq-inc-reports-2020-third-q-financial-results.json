Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of the Company's operating performance because it provides information on the Company's ability to provide operating cash flows for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in its industry.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"The non-IFRS financial measure is used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of IFRS financial measures.

Because non-IFRS financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-IFRS financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-IFRS adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"The table below reconciles net loss from operations and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block","content":[],"data":{"target":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"nph7if1oawhd"}},"id":"5IPu80JhyXTMQL4VxBFfYL","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-11-27T16:52:57.064Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-27T16:52:57.064Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Financials - 2020 Q3","description":"Financials - 2020 Q3","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/nph7if1oawhd/5IPu80JhyXTMQL4VxBFfYL/1658f01836f16905f8eb05607088c41b/Financials_-_2020_Q3.jpg","details":{"size":67500,"image":{"width":767,"height":398}},"fileName":"Financials - 2020 Q3.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"About EQ Works","marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"EQ Works (","marks":[],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"hyperlink","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"www.eqworks.com","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{"uri":"http://www.eqworks.com/"}},{"nodeType":"text","value":") enables businesses to understand, predict, and influence customer behaviour. Using unique data sets, advanced analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, EQ Works creates actionable intelligence for businesses to attract, retain, and grow the customers that matter most. The Company’s proprietary SaaS platform mines insights from movement and geospatial data, enabling businesses to close the loop between digital and real-world consumer actions.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"Neither the TSX-V nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX-V) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.","marks":[{"type":"italic"}],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"Forward-Looking Statements","marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"Certain statements contained in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements”.
