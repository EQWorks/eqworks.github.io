Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-IFRS financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-IFRS financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-IFRS adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring.\r\nThe table below reconciles net loss from operations and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block","content":[],"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"nph7if1oawhd"}},"id":"3GKuZCWhSpYQIEPbTPAMRR","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2021-04-15T18:15:45.745Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-15T18:15:45.746Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Adjusted EBITDA for three and twelve months","description":"Adjusted EBITDA results for three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/nph7if1oawhd/3GKuZCWhSpYQIEPbTPAMRR/3837bccfdace176656182c91144f2ee2/Screen_Shot_2021-04-15_at_2.14.27_PM.png","details":{"size":154750,"image":{"width":1200,"height":650}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2021-04-15 at 2.14.27 PM.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"nodeType":"hr","content":[],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"About EQ Works","marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"text","value":"\r","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"EQ Works (www.eqworks.com) enables businesses to understand, predict, and influence customer behaviour.
